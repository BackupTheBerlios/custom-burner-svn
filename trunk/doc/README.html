<h1>Custom Burner - README</h1>

<p>This program can be used to burn CDs on many computers, each with one
CD burner.</p>

<p>It consists of a client and a server program. They can run both on the
same machine, so that the server can burn CDs too.</p>

<p>This program is thought to be useful in a CD-Burning party, as in Free
Software days (LinuxDay, etc.). It should provide a dumb queue for
burning lots of CDs for lots of people.</p>


<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<ul>
<li>Python 2.4 with threading support;

<li>ISOs on the clients;</li>

<li>a program to burn ISOs from command line, ready to go (e.g. cdrecord).</li>
</ul>


<h2>Installation</h2>

<ol>
<li>Decompress the archive in your favorite directory</li>

<li>Start the server</li>

<li>Start the clients</li>
</ol>


<h2>The server</h2>

<p>The server's job is to manage the ISO queue. You must use it to type
in the images to burn, and it will take care of queuing them, keeping
track of which client is working and feeding jobs to the idle ones.</p>

<p>Logging messages will tell you if clients accept the jobs, and if they
succeed to burn them.</p>

<p>For each job, you must supply two information: the name of the file to
burn and the name of the person that CD is for.</p>

<p>The program can be configured using command-line parameters. Run it with
the option "<tt>--help</tt>" for more information.</p>


<h2>The client</h2>

<p>The client program connects to the server and receives job submissions
from it.</p>

<p>When it is started, it scans the local directory containing the ISOs and
sends a list to the server.</p>

<p>When the client receives a job request, it starts the burning program
that you specified. That program must return 0 if everything went ok.</p>

<p>The program can be configured using command-line parameters. Run it with
the option "<tt>--help</tt>" for more information.</p>

<p><b>Important</b>: please make sure that the ISOs are stored on the
client's local hard drive. You should not burn ISOs from a network shared
directory, because you may incur into buffer underruns and other problems:
networks are often much slower than CD burners.</p>


<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

<p>If you like this program, and would like to contribute, please feel
free to do it! But if you want to look at the code, please know I'm
no Python hacker... :-) Please start reading the <a
href="README.dev.html">developer README</a></p>

<p>Please note that I take no responsibility and/or liability for any use
you could make of this program. Please don't use it to do anything
illegal.</p>
